# Commute-Cast

CommuteCast is a browser-based signal intelligence tool that learns your commute route and warns you before you hit areas of weak connectivity. As you travel, it tracks your GPS position and continuously measures network quality — monitoring jitter, latency, and packet loss — building up a personal signal map of every stretch of your route. Over time it uses that history to predict signal conditions ahead of you, alerting you before dead zones hit so you can send that message or finish that call before you lose connection.
